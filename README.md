# EMT-Met

MATLAB algorithm for calculating the EMT score based on methylation levels

Author: Minsun S. Jeon, Jing Li

Description
-------

The EMT-Met Toolbox is a MATLAB package designed for analyzing the spectrum of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in biological samples. 
This toolbox provides computational tools to quantify EMT dynamics using methylation data, enabling researchers to assess epigenetic changes associated with EMT states. 
The algorithm uses reference Epithelial (E) and Mesenchymal (M) genes, which can be customized by users according to their specific research needs or existing reference gene lists. 
This flexibility allows for tailored analyses across diverse biological contexts and experimental setups. 

Installation
--------
You can download the MATLAB toolbox ("EMT-Met.mltbx") to use with your local MATLAB installation. The toolbox has a demo code available.
